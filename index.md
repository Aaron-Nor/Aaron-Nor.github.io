### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

  Lab 2 is my first favorite lab, including both parts. This is because this is the first lab where I felt like we were really starting to code.
  I learned during this lab that we can make some    pretty cool small projects with minimal coding.

* Lab 7

  My second favorite was Lab 7, part 2. This is because this was the first lab where we worked with images.
  What I learned from this specific lab is that when we incorporate other elements into   our code, we can elevate our projects.

* Lab 10

  My third favorite lab is lab 10, part 2. This is because lab 10 part 2 felt much more different than any lab we had prior.
  It taught me we can use code to make programs that help us in the real world.
